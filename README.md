 Pro Tips for Your Interview
Start with simple commands and build up complexity
Use wc -l to count lines when asked for counts
Remember that grep -F is faster for literal strings
Use grep -P for complex regex patterns
Master the pipeline: grep | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
Practice using less for navigating large files
Use grep -o to extract only matching parts
Remember grep -v to exclude patterns
Combine multiple greps in a pipeline to narrow results
