# Cyber Investigation Practice Lab

A comprehensive command-line forensics training environment designed to help you master network and log analysis skills for cybersecurity interviews and incident response scenarios.

## üìã Overview

This repository contains realistic log files and progressive challenges that simulate real-world cybersecurity investigations. Practice grep, regex patterns, and shell pipelines in a safe, controlled environment.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- **grep mastery**: `-F` (fixed strings), `-P` (Perl regex), `-o` (extract), `-v` (invert), `-i` (case-insensitive)
- **Advanced regex patterns**: Email extraction, IP address matching, hash detection, JWT tokens, and more
- **Shell pipelines**: Combining commands with `|`, using `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `awk`, `head`, `tail`
- **Log analysis**: HTTP access logs, SSH authentication logs, application logs, network traffic
- **Security pattern recognition**: SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, brute force attacks, encoded payloads

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Navigate to the logs directory
```bash
cd ~/cyber_investigation/logs
```

### 2. Explore the log files
```bash
ls -lh                  # See available log files
less access.log         # Browse web server logs
less auth.log           # Review authentication attempts
less application.log    # Check application errors
less network.log        # Analyze network traffic
less suspicious.txt     # Examine suspicious patterns
```

### 3. Practice freely
Try commands on your own:
```bash
grep -F "192.168.1.105" access.log
grep -P "Failed password" auth.log | wc -l
grep -oP '\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}' access.log | sort -u
```

### 4. Take the challenge
```bash
bash ~/cyber_investigation/scripts/verify.sh
```

Choose between:
- **Hints mode** (Recommended for first attempt) - Shows commands to guide you
- **Expert mode** - Test your knowledge without hints

### 5. Check answers (if stuck)
```bash
bash ~/cyber_investigation/scripts/answers.sh
```

## üí° Pro Tips for Interview Success

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Count lines
wc -l file.log

# Fixed string search (faster, literal)
grep -F "exact string" file.log

# Perl regex search (powerful patterns)
grep -P "regex pattern" file.log

# Extract only matching parts
grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+' file.log

# Case-insensitive search
grep -i "error" file.log

# Invert match (exclude)
grep -v "DEBUG" file.log
```

### Pipeline Patterns
```bash
# Count occurrences and sort by frequency
grep pattern file.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Get unique values only
grep pattern file.log | sort -u

# Extract specific field with awk
grep pattern file.log | awk '{print $5}'

# Limit output to top N results
grep pattern file.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10

# Chain multiple greps for precision
grep "ERROR" file.log | grep -v "timeout" | grep "database"
```

### Regex Cheat Sheet
```bash
# IP address (basic)
\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}

# Email address
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}

# Phone number (various formats)
(\+\d{1,2}[- ])?\(?\d{3}\)?[- .]?\d{3}[- .]?\d{4}

# Hexadecimal (MAC, hashes)
[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:...  # MAC address
\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b                    # MD5 hash
\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b                    # SHA256 hash

# JWT token
eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]+

# Time ranges
10:5[0-9]:                          # 10:50-10:59
11:0[0-9]:                          # 11:00-11:09

# Alternation (OR)
(ERROR|FATAL|CRITICAL)              # Match any
(POST|PUT|DELETE|PATCH)             # HTTP methods
```

## üéì Learning Path

### Beginner (Challenges 1-6)
Focus on basic grep usage and simple patterns. Learn to use `-F` for literal strings and `-P` for basic regex. Practice counting and filtering.

### Intermediate (Challenges 7-10)
Apply grep to security scenarios. Learn to identify attack patterns like SQL injection, suspicious user agents, and non-standard HTTP methods.

### Advanced (Challenges 11-20)
Master complex regex patterns. Extract structured data (emails, IPs, hashes), perform time-based analysis, and recognize attack taxonomies.

## üîç Common Interview Questions

1. **"Show me all failed login attempts from a specific IP"**
   ```bash
   grep "Failed password" auth.log | grep "10.0.0.55"
   ```

2. **"What are the top 5 most active IP addresses?"**
   ```bash
   grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+' access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5
   ```

3. **"Find all POST requests that returned 500 errors"**
   ```bash
   grep "POST" access.log | grep "\" 500"
   ```

4. **"Extract all unique user agents accessing /admin"**
   ```bash
   grep "/admin" access.log | grep -oP '"[^"]+"\s*$' | sort -u
   ```

5. **"How many unique users successfully logged in?"**
   ```bash
   grep "Accepted" auth.log | grep -oP 'for \K\w+' | sort -u | wc -l
   ```

## üèÜ Scoring System

- **20/20**: Perfect score - Interview ready!
- **16-19**: Great job - Practice missed challenges
- **12-15**: Good progress - Review grep flags and pipelines
- **0-11**: Keep practicing - Review the basics

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Create custom challenges
Add your own log entries to the files in `logs/` directory.

### Test specific skills
```bash
# Practice only IP extraction
grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+' logs/*.log | less

# Practice only error detection
grep -P '(ERROR|FATAL|CRITICAL)' logs/*.log | less

# Practice time-based filtering
grep -P '10:[3-5][0-9]:' logs/application.log
```

### Pipeline debugging
```bash
# Test each step of a pipeline individually
grep "pattern" file.log                          # Step 1
grep "pattern" file.log | sort                   # Step 2
grep "pattern" file.log | sort | uniq -c         # Step 3
grep "pattern" file.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn  # Step 4
```

**Good luck with your interview preparation! üöÄ**

*Remember: The goal isn't just to find the answer, but to understand the command and be able to explain it during an interview.*
