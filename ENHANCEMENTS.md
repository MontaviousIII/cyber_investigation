## ðŸ“Š Statistics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Challenges | 10 | 20 | +100% |
| Log Entries (total) | ~65 | ~316 | +386% |
| Regex Patterns Covered | 8 | 20+ | +150% |
| Attack Types Simulated | 5 | 30+ | +500% |
| README Size | 1 KB | 10+ KB | +900% |

## ðŸŽ¯ Training Focus

The enhancements heavily focus on:

1. **Regex Pattern Mastery** - 10 new challenges specifically designed for advanced regex practice
2. **Real-World Patterns** - Email, phone, IP, hash, token recognition
3. **Security Pattern Recognition** - Attack classification and technique identification
4. **Data Extraction** - Using lookahead, lookbehind, and capturing groups
5. **Complex Pipelines** - Multi-stage data processing

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

### Advanced Regex Techniques Used

- **Lookahead/Lookbehind**: `\K` to extract portions after match
- **Character Classes**: `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` for email validation
- **Quantifiers**: `{2,7}` for flexible IPv6 matching
- **Alternation**: `(ERROR|FATAL|CRITICAL)` for multi-pattern
- **Word Boundaries**: `\b` for precise hash matching
- **Non-capturing Groups**: `(?:...)` for grouping without capture
- **Optional Patterns**: `?` for flexible phone number formats

### Log Format Coverage
